# Large airports


The Web site  [OurAirports](http://ourairports.com/)  provides open data about international airports. Among the provided data files we can find:

-   [airports.csv](https://ourairports.com/data/airports.csv): general information on all airports
-   [countries.csv](https://ourairports.com/data/countries.csv): A list of the world's countries. You need this spreadsheet to interpret the .country codes in the airports file  
 
This task is intended to find the 10 countries having more airports of the "large" category, displaying on the screen the country name and the number of airports, ordered in descending order by the number of airports. The output should look like this:

| name           | count |
|----------------|-------|
| United States  | 170   |
| China          | 33    |
| United Kingdom | 29    |
| Russia         | 19    |
| Italy          | 18    |
| Germany        | 17    |
| Turkey         | 14    |
| Canada         | 12    |
| Japan          | 12    |
| India          | 11    |

Develop a program to carry out this task, called "largeAirportsRDD.py/java" or "largeAirportsDT.py/java".  

The deliverable will be composed of the programs and a screen capture of their outputs.
