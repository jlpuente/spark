# Notebook of some basic operations over PySpark DataFrames

The goal is to develop a Jupyter notebook including the code provided in the  basicOperations.py  file. All the steps should be commented.

Additional aspects to be evaluated include the proper management of the conversions between dataframes and RDDs (we saw in the classroom that the provided code is not compatible with Spark 3.3.2) and the use of a data file that is not the same as the one we have been working with.
