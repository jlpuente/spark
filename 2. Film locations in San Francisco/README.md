# Film locations in San Francisco


San Francisco's open data portal provides a  [web site](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am)  with data on the city's film sites. The data can obtained as a CSV.  

This exercise is about developing a RDD-based Spark program in Java/Python that finds those films with 20 or more locations and print them on the screen. Furthermore, the program must print the number of films and the average of locations per flim. A typical output will be as follows:  

```
(58, Murder in the First)
(30, Chance Season 2)
(29, The Dead Pool)
(28, Etruscan Smile)
(28, Blue Jasmine)

Total number of films: 309
The average of film locations per film: 5.333333  
```

The deliverables of this exercise will be three files, two containing the source codes and another one with the output file.
